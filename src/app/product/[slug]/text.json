The meaning of EMI is very clear from the same which means we will have to pay back an equal amount of money every month for the loan. EMI can be considered as the fixed amount of money that a borrower has to pay back to the lender every month on a fixed date in the calendar. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fatafatsewa.com\/news-detail\/0-emi-service-in-nepal\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 102, 204);\"><strong>0% EMI Service in Nepal<\/strong><\/a><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\"> is applied on both principals as well as interest so that eventually every amount of loan is paid off in the allocated time.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">EMI has come quite an in practice these days because of its perks and benefits. It makes it possible to get those things and services which we can afford at present. For <\/span><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\">e<\/span><span style=\"color: var(--clrSquiggleHighlightTextColor,#000000);\">xample <\/span><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">mobiles on EMI, Cameras on EMI, student loans on EMI, cars on EMI, and paying back the amount as per our salary.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">The process to apply for EMI is very easy. Everything has its pros, cons, and process. We want you to be clear about everything before thinking about getting an EMI. So, we have included everything you need to know about EMI in this article along with, \u2018how you can apply?\u2019, and ' what you get on EMI'.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Is EMI service good or bad?&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Well, it entirely depends on how you are using it. If people use Emi by properly understating all terms and conditions then there\u2019s no way to have the bad effect of EMI on us. So, we can inherit EMI services either good or bad.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">As far as I can consider, EMI has much more pros than cons unless you consider debt as a bad thing. EMI allows us to explore and achieve things that we cannot afford at present. This type of loan divides the amount to be equal. This allows us to plan our financial strategy properly. We already know about our obligations and can have a more stable lifestyle even after a loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">How does EMI service work?&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">EMI has its payment plan when we compare it with a variable payment plan. It allows us to pay only a fixed amount of payment every month to the lender. Through EMI service, both the lender as well as the borrower are equally benefitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">The lender has a predictably steady source of income from loan interest every month. And the borrower also knows about the exact amount that they have to the lender. This makes the personal budgeting of the individual much easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">How to apply for EMI?&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;\">To apply for EMI, one must have a credit card. We are soon launching this service where you can apply for EMI without a credit card, stay tuned with us for that.
